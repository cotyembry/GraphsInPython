Due: 17 FEB 17
Instructions:
• For this assignment you will be performing data analysis and
charting using the matplotlib library for Python.
• You will be processing Typical Meteorological Year 3 data
from the National Solar Radiation Database. This information
is available at the following website:
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/
• There is data available for many sites around the US, your
Python program should be able to take any TMY3 file as input.
• On program start ask the user which TMY3 file they would like
to process from the current input directory.
• Give the user a selection among (at a minimum): dry bulb
temperature, humidity, and global horizontal irradiation.
• Ask the user if they would like to plot:
o scatter chart by hour of the day
o monthly minimum, maximum, and average
o discrete values for each hour of the year.
• You are free to choose the best charting type implementation
for each of the above, including chart type, colors, axes, etc.
